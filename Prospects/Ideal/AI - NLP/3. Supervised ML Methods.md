Bag of Words - [Source](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/simplifying-sentiment-analysis-python)

The formulation of sentiment analysis as a problem involves categorizing documents, such as tweets, reviews, or articles, into predefined classes (e.g., positive or negative sentiment). Each training example consists of a document paired with its sentiment label, and the objective is to create a classifier that can predict the sentiment of new documents.

In sentiment analysis, not all words contribute equally to conveying sentiment. Neutral words like "I" or "are" are generally irrelevant, and the focus is on identifying sentiment-specific words. Feature selection plays a crucial role in this process by highlighting words such as "love" or "great," which strongly indicate the sentiment of the text.

One fundamental concept used in sentiment analysis is the Bag of Words (BoW) model. BoW represents a document as a set of unique words and their frequencies while disregarding word order. This approach simplifies text representation and highlights the presence of sentiment-indicative words while ignoring irrelevant terms.

Documents are transformed into BoW feature vectors, which are then paired with their sentiment labels to form a training set, also known as a corpus. These feature vectors serve as input for machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, for classification.

This structured approach simplifies the complex task of text classification by emphasizing the critical role of relevant words in defining sentiment, making sentiment analysis computationally feasible and effective.
